# 🔥 Wildfire Detection using CNN + VGG16

A deep learning-based image classification project to detect wildfire scenes from real-world images using a custom CNN and transfer learning with VGG16.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust wildfire detection model that can distinguish between wildfire and non-wildfire images with high accuracy. It is designed to assist in early identification of forest fires based on visual data.

Key Features:
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and pretrained VGG16 architecture
- Achieved over **90% accuracy and F1-score** on test data
- Evaluated using metrics like **ROC curve, AUC score, confusion matrix**
- Deployed via an interactive **Streamlit web app on Hugging Face Spaces**

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- Hugging Face Spaces (for deployment)

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** ~91%
- **F1 Score:** ~0.91
- **AUC:** > 0.95
